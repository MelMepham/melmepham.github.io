    Reflections into the journey of EDA through the musings of <a a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Sherref</a>
  </p>
<div class="padding">
  <h4>Wednesday the 8th of November</h4>
  <p>
    So, I struggle with the whole idea of writing a blog, something about writing stuff for everyone else to see seems a little egoic, or maybe I am just a little afraid of my voice sometimes. I notice there are a set of questions I need to answer, I initially wrote out all the questions and then put my explanation below them, but that seems a little bland and sterile, so I thought I would come at it from a different approach and step outside my comfort zone a little more.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have known a couple of different people to go through EDA, it seems like a well-rounded holistic learning environment which was the thing that drew me toward it more so than the content. As an artist and print graphic designer I have always avoided new technology, as it seemed to take away from technique that I was holding onto as being something tapu..
  </p>
  <p>
    I love how EDA is looking at new and fresh ideas to create solutions to current issues facing our planet. Compassion, integrity, collaboration and communication are skills that need to be nurtured and promoted, explored and understood so people can move into the future positively. I have always wanted to be a change maker, to do things differently, to inspire and promote authentic living but I have always been stuck because I have this old mentality, I am really excited to move into a new and creative way to look at both education and industry, and believe it has the ability to be really transformative for my own personal journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am very nervous about the EDA journey, I can be self-conscious, and think down on myself, but I feel like the learning environment is going to allow me a platform to work at and change some of my learnt behaviour. I also donâ€™t believe my expectations have changed much from what I thought I was getting myself into before I started to now.. Maybe a little apprehensive about the amount of learning that will be done with other people? Throughout all of my previous education I have kept to myself a lot, I think because of early school day bullying, but again, I am excited to see how I can overcome some of these things.
