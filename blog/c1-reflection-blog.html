    <h1>Reflections</h1>
    <p>Reflections into the journey of EDA through the musings of <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Sherref</a></p>

    <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
    <p>I think education takes a whole lot of different forms, and I love how DBC and EDA are taking a fresh and interesting
    approach to teaching really relivant skills in an interesting and creative way.</p>

    <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
    <p><a href = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/impression> impression</a></p>
    <p>1. a strong effect produced on the intellect, feelings, conscience, etc.</p>
    <p>2. the first and immediate effect of an experience or perception upon the mind; sensation.</p>
    <p>My impression is that this experience as a whole has the ability to be really transformative, providing
    I give it the time and attention it needs to be such an experience. </p>

    <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
    <p>I am all for vunerability, and being realy open and honest about my short falls and sucesses so I think
    the learning environment will be one that I will thrive in. I will probably struggle to begin with forming
    connections with other students, I have had some pretty traumatic learning environments in the past and it
    has lead to a response of isolation. I am really excited about different approaches to learning and working
    industries and under normal circumstances I wouldn't go to an education provider to learn code.</p>

    <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
    <p>No. My expectations of EDA have not changed after watching that video, maybe the realisation of the
    amount of group work that will be involved, but it is a hurdle I am willing to tackle!</p>

    <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
    <p>I think if I wasn't feeling nervous right now I would be too confident... I think this is a silly question
    I don't know why you would enrol to learn a new set of skills if it didn't excite you.</p>
