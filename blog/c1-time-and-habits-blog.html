    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    <p>Is productivity a measure of success?</p>
    <h4>Wednesday the 8th of November</h4>
    <p>I guess I will start with saying that I don’t feel like I have any massive issues with productivity, or working self-directed. As an artist, the things I struggle most with is a work/social/creative balance. I have yet to find a combo that doesn’t loose one of these three components, which is why I am actively working on merging work and creativity.. </p>
    <p>The thing I found most interesting about these readings actually is it made me aware of the sheer amount people are searching for ways to improve their productivity. I lived in Melbourne for about a year when I had finished University and one thing that I really didn’t like about living in a city that size (and it is small compared to some cities in this world!) was how fast the city moved! When I first got there I tried to keep up, but it is not humanly possible to keep up with a city of that size and walk away without some massive health issues. I guess that was my lesson in how it is ok to take the time and space I need in order to live a good life. I then moved out of the city not long after that realisation because I felt there was social expectations I was not willing to live up to. </p>
    <p>I have worked in the hospitality industry most of my life and maybe the reason why I have never had to worry about increasing productivity is because my jobs have been as productive as they have needed to be purely by turning up to work and serving people you are being productive…</p>
    <p>I have worked with experimenting with mindfulness and meditation as a way to relieve stress (which I guess adds to extra productivity..?). I find these tools massively positive, however I fall out of the habit because I put too much expectation on myself to sit for 30 minutes or do more, the changing habits techniques regarding moving in tiny steps could be a really positive way to increase the benefits of these activities.</p>
    <p>I have decided for the next little while as well I will work at experimenting with the 25 minute intervals, this is really to make sure I stop and take breaks rather than increasing productivity. I have never attempted to spend so much time in front of a screen so it goes hand in hand with good physical health practices.</p>
