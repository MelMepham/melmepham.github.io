        I read this chapter a couple of weeks ago, so it was just a recap for me, I completely agree that emotional intelligence is something that is learnt, and we have to overcome a lot of negative habits, which we learnt through our childhood and into our adulthood, and mindfulness is a really good way to change these habits. Basically anything can be learnt and the way to learn is to be aware and recognise behaviour.

        I practice meditation and mindfulness on a regular basis, meditation less because I always try and sit for at least 30 minutes which usually feels like a task. I really like the idea of doing two minutes of meditation as a way build up a good foundation.
