  <h1>MEDITATION PROCESS</h1>

      <h4>Tues the 14th of November</h4>
      <p>
        Process over product… I am always going to be concerned with product, and I don’t really learn things if they don't have  tangible outcomes, so although I did’t spend hours looking at design I believe process and product work hand in hand with each other.. I guess I used my existing square space website as a base for my design, I used the same colours and type because I knew that was going to be a winning combo and would mean I would’t have to think as much about the design while still keeping some integrity…

        So before I started reading the second chapter of “search inside yourself” I believed that meditation was a tool that was proven to have a massive amount of benefit. That it serves much more of a purpose than just serving monks that spend their lives meditating. it is a tool for self-discovery, lowers anxiety, can increase the over-all feeling of mental wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        While reading the chapter there was nothing that I read that I got overly excited about. I liked the response about it doesn’t matter where you are, how you sit, what success you have, its more about attempting and intention. This is a really nice way to explain it and get people interested without overwhelming people, its not usually about the goal of spending your whole life meditating, but of the small hidden benefits of self-care.

        After reading another students blog it has also made me reflect on how it is being used to benefit big corporation, and it is being sucked into the mainstream and I wonder how much of what they are saying is true? I don’t think mindfulness should be a way to increase productivity. if that is something that happens on a side note then that is fine, but we don’t need to know how to work harder, we need to learn how to relax and turn off. I have worked myself to a point of breaking for someone else and if they had tried to use mindfulness techniques to make me work that hard for longer thats not compassionate or productive.  So although I believe meditation and mindfulness are amazingly powerful techniques they shouldn’t be used for the wrong reasons.
