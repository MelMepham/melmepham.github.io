        I am currently living by myself at the moment, the conversation tools that run through this chapter are communication tools I have learnt in other areas of my life, mainly in non-violent communication strategies. I was unable to utilise these techniques for this blog, but in the past, it has been interesting using them and being aware of just how much you don’t focus on other people when they are talking, or you do until you have something you want to say back to them, and then you think about that, not listening to anything else the person has to say! really focusing on listening gives you a whole other way to communicate with people, and it allows a level of compassion or empathy often lost in communication.

        My mindfulness practice has not and will not change after reading this chapter.

      I found myself noticing how much the writer has gendered the participants. I did notice that there was a lot of interchanging with he and she but I couldn’t help to thing that writing with they or them would have read just as well if not better. I think this too is a good use of mindfulness, being aware of language and how it affects the way people interact with you, and how it shouldn’t.
