        The reason I started wanting to explore meditation and mindfulness was because I wanted to have a clearer view of myself, being able to distinguish what is physically real, and what is our emotion or perception on a situation leads to being able to recognise and change behaviour. To recognise that my emotions are a part of me, but they are not me, I think about the body like this as well, our body is a part of me, but it is not me. my thoughts are a part of me, but they are not me.

        Over the past four years I have learnt so much about myself, my triggers and how to look at the world a little more objectively, and it has had a massively positive impact on my life! I still have a long way to go but 5 years ago I was sure my fate was set and my habits were just who I am, now I know changing habits and recognising and accepting faults is very powerful.

        I use to journal a lot when I was younger and I use to only write about the bad things in my life, because I wanted to use it as a tool to express myself. Now that has lead to a perception that if I keep a journal it has to be filled with all my heart ache and its not that much fun being so negative, it would be interesting to purposefully start writing a journal and only using positive cues, but that is a mission for another day. Today I did a body scan, this tool is really beneficial because its nice to see where I am holding stress and tension, at the moment that seems to be in my shoulders and upper back, it was nice realising that and being able to breathe into that area a little bit and loosen it up slightly. I find I hold most of my stress in my shoulders.
