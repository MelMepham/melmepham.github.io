        So, triggers and stuff eh? This is a pretty good week to be looking at what my triggers are when I am learning new things and how I overcome them..
      </p>
      <p>
        My triggers usually come from me feeling like I don’t have enough support and feel like I am doing things alone, or that asking for help is a sign of weakness. All of these things add to a feeling of worthlessness “I am not good enough”, “ The fact I can not do this makes me stupid”, “what was I thinking when I thought this was a good idea?”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have these triggers I am able to over come them by taking a step back, and when I get somewhere or understand something it makes all of the struggle worth while. I am constantly teaching myself new things, so although I know this struggle well, I also really enjoy it. I don’t get angry very much, just anxious about the decisions I have made.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the Siberian North Railroad exercise, any exercise to stop, think, breathe and reflect is really valuable. I think for me it’s the remembering to breathe that is a big one, and taking that time to focus on breath lets gives my mind space to see the situation more objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week has been quite tough because I have had some personal stuff go on as well, and it definitely feels like this is ramping up and I don’t feel like I am very well equipped to succeed in this but I know that is just my mind playing tricks on me, and I am dedicated to moving forward.
