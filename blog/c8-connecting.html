      <h4>Saturday the 23rd of December</h4>
      <p>
        So when it came time a couple of days ago to look at writing my Cultural Blog I was feeling a real lack of empathy, there are a whole lot of things which has lead to this, so I decided to give it a couple of days to try and get myself into a better mindset. Alas, my mindset has not changed much so I thought I may as well just give this a second go and see if it serves me any better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be honest, I am tired, I broke some of my toes a couple of days ago, which has lead to some back pains and some friends of mine have acted in ways which have left me with a feeling of deep disappointment.
      <p>
        I have over the past while been trying to be really open and honest, and hear other peoples views with empathy, I find it really difficult to distance my own feelings with other peoples reasonings. My biggest fear is being let down, and I think because of this I let myself down more than is necessary, and react to others with a lack of empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The loving kindness meditation helped me let some things go, but they still didn’t change my own emotions, maybe allowed me to be a little more ok with them. I have forgiven people for things they have done that have harmed me so much in my life because thats what I was told is right, but just because you forgive someone doesn’t mean you need to put yourself in a situation with that person again that may lead to a repeat, and I have found it difficult to distinguish forgiveness with friendship if that makes sense?
      </p>
      <p>
        With retrospect I can see others points of views and understand why they did things, and where it was coming from, and how two experiences can be valid and very different. I don’t think I want to share any of those experiences right now but they are musing around my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has been a really difficult year for me, and sitting at the end of it and looking back has been bringing a lot of the year back to the forefront of my mind. I am trying to look back with empathy and understanding. 
      </p>
