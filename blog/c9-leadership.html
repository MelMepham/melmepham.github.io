        My last full time job was managing a cafe of 40 staff, I was ultimately responsible for all of them, I felt with all of the HR stuff and hiring staff, it was super challenging in terms of compassionate leadership. I found the balance of friend/boss a really hard one, I didn’t want to create really strong friendships because I didn’t want to favour anyone. As my first real management experience I can say with confidence that I did not have the skills required to do this job, but I did however try my best, and tried two approach every situation with empathy and compassion, but I know I still have a very long way to go.

        As I was in my last blog post I am struggling to be really positive at the moment, that feeling hasn’t really gone away.. doing the meditation gave me some relief for a period, but there is something deeper at work. Doing the tangle meditation also did not relieve any of my hurt. to be honest, it just made me feel more bitter about the world.

      <p>
        How does this model relate to Phase-0? To be honest, I think the reason Phase-0 has been so hard for me is because I feel as I have no status, due to me knowing nothing about coding at the beginning, I have no certainty with anything in my life right now, I have a high feeling of stress and a lack of autonomy, I do not know anyone that I will be going though bootcamp with so a don’t relate very well, and I have been dealing with issues in my own world regarding power and gender norms, a women going into the tech industry doesn’t seem like a fair road..
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope going through the bootcamp, and just being around people will help me ground these things and provide a strong foundation for me to move forward, but I am also trying to go into bootcamp with no expectations apart from the fact that it will be hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have another foundation for hard conversations that I prefer to the one in this book and that is to start the conversation and say 1. Are you willing to have this conversation and is now the right time? 2. Articulate why I am concerned at having this conversation. 3. What my best scenario is for the outcome 4. Say the hard thing. This technique has actually helped me in the past having difficult situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any other musings? I have struggled getting into coding a lot over the past couple of weeks, Christmas, New Years.. 2017 was the hardest year of my life so far. Some really amazing things happened but some of the worst things happened as well, I have been reflecting, and trying to focus on the positive and what the new year has to offer. And the less coding I do the worse I feel, I am going to be glad when the bootcamp starts, I am really looking forward to being in an environment that allows me to focus on one thing, and for the mean time put all of my woes to rest. I am looking forward to working hard, and I am hoping it will provide me with a good platform to jump into the new year.
