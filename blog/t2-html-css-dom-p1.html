    <h4 class ="heading">Monday the 13th of November</h4>
    <p class ="body">So you want to know what HTML, CSS and Dom are and how they relate to each other?
</p>
<p class ="body">If we were to think about a tree, HTML would be the branches coming up out of the ground, giving the tree structure and strength, CSS would define the shape of the bark, the colour of the leaves and DOM would be the roots, the parts of the tree that you don’t see but it is what makes everything work below the surface.
</p>
<p class ="body">So something that has been drilled into me from my design experience is the importance of grids! it makes design look tidy and means that everything can be proportioned properly. shock horror, it is also the skeleton of every webpage, and website style. and its what is technically called ‘boxifying’.
</p>
<p class ="body">So, its not just enough to have a bunch of boxes on a page, we also need to think about margins and spacing between things. CSS has a ‘box model’ which wraps around all HTML elements, and it consists at the centre of ‘content’ around that we have ‘padding’, the ‘border’ and lastly the ‘margin'. </p>
