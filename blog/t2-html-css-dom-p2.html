              So this is the Udacity blog part two, it seems I have been asked to talk about the same subject again regarding grid based design.. so I guess we can go into some more detail.
            </p>
            <p class ="body">
              Dealing with front-end programming we have to be aware of how to make things functional, this goes beyond the initial “make it work” stage, user experience also adds to the functionality of a website, if you have no clear hierarchy and composition, the user will have no idea how to navigate your website, one of the easiest ways to create hierarchy and composition is with grids, not only do they make it functional for the user, it also creates good functionality as a website on the whole. Grid based design splits the page into a grid (usually 3, 4, 6, 8 or and puts boxes in those rows and columns to create a beautiful site!
            </p>
            <p class ="body">
              Along with making it functional we have to think about how technological advances change the way we look at utilising the tools we are learning, a big one right now is the amount of different devices people are using for apps and to search the web. We as the developers need to make it easy for the user to use our site on whatever device they have, this is called ‘responsive design’ where the code is smart enough to change its layout depending on the resolution of the screen. Imagine setting up an online shop and it only being able to be used on a computer, how much business would you loose? so not only does ‘responsive design’ keep your design looking sharp everywhere, its also much better for business.

              I am not going to lie, when I was asked “What is Semantic Structure” I completely blanked and went to the internet to help me out a little bit.. <a a target="_blank" href= http://opencontent.org/docs/semantics.html> "Semantic structure is a fancy term for an organization that represents meaning. “ </a> So basically its do with the way you structure something to get the best productive use out of it…
            </p>
            <p class ="body">
              I struggle a little with these tutorials because I already have a solid foundation of design principles and what makes a good website, but I do enjoy the way they described such a simple way of using grids. I started with the bootstrap language and it has been a bit confusing so this has made the understanding a little clearer.
