  <h1>DESIGN TO WEB</h1>
  <p class="pullquote">What are some easy ways to move yout designs from ideas to actual webpages?</p>
  <div class="padding">
    <h4>Tuesday the 14th of November</h4>

      As we talked about in the last post, responsive design is really important in todays day and age because of the multitude of different devices people look at content with. One really easy way to make sure your content looks the best on the smallest screen size is to use a technique called “mobile first design”. It is pretty self-explanatory. Basically make sure you design looks good on the smallest screen size and then work up from there! that means your info will be more accessible to a wider audience and you will keep the design integrity!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are so many people now working in the tech industry, people are bound to run in and have to solve the same types of problems, there is two ways to overcome this. Either you write your own code, or you look at what other people have already written and use what we call ‘Frameworks”. These are basically libraries of code people have written to deal with similar issues. check out this website that I have used, I have used a framework called <a target="_blank" href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> to create a nice responsive grid system without having to write a bunch of code myself! Check it out, resize my page and see what you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I started designing my website in my text editor, I sketched what is commonly called a ‘wireframe’ in the industry. Basically its a sketch to show what the skeleton or basic grid of my page will look like this helped me with the initial stages of having to figure out what things needed to be grouped and to make sure my design would look good on both mobile and desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wireframe was the first sketch I did, which was bad design on my part but I really just wanted to sink my teeth into playing with what I could do! Check out my initial sketches.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="three columns">
      <img class="wireframe" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-mobile">
      <p><i>mobile index page</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="three columns">
      <img class="wireframe"src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-desktop">
      <p><i>desktop index page</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="three columns">
      <img class="wireframe" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-mobile">
      <p><i>mobile blog page</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="three columns">
      <img class="wireframe" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-desktop">
      <p><i>desktop blog page</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  As you can see on the left hand side we have the index pages, and the right we have the blog pages. I had trouble initially setting up the grid, the first blog page I made was using another framework, so getting use to this one really turned me on my head, it took me an hour and a half and a bunch of code that I then trashed to realise I hadn’t linked the style sheets to my HTML document..
</p>
<p>
  Apart from that The heading was a bit of a nightmare to get good responsive but I think I  got it, I would like to make slight changes to bits and pieces but all together I am happy! you will also notice on the blog pages I wanted to have the header and incorporate the image that corresponds with the blog on the index pages, but the design looked silly and I had a great idea half way through to use the area that I put my logo on which solved that design issue!
