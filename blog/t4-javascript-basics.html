    <h4>Saturday the 18th of November</h4>
    <p>
      So, I have jumped into JavaScript (JS) and have spent the last 15 hours or so trying to wrap my head around some basic concepts. JS is VERY different to CSS and HTML, I feel like its the language that sits in the background and tells everything else what to do.. although all languages group things together to get working blocks of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      JS works on a control flow, I guess HTML and CSS also do this, and this is basically the order in which the computer runs the code, top to bottom, left to write, which is most important with things like loops. Loops are bits of code that loop until the code does a certain thing. I am trying to think about how to explain this with an example of every day life but it is proving difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you think about your nightly ritual, you have a shower, get into your PJ’s lock the door and brush your teeth, the control flow is the order in which you do those things, Lets say you have stored in your computer your morning, night and mid day routines, some of these things you do twice a day, like brush your teeth, loops store all of the information, but depending on the formula you use depends on what information is pulled out for the different times of the day…
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different ways of storing information, we have arrays, which are lines of text such as [“a”, “b”, “c”], and objects, this could be something like
    </p>
    <p>
      var “Morning” { “Alarm”: 7, “Bathroom”: “shower”, “brush teeth”, “wash hair” }
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a group of information that has different levels and layers of information. pulling information out of arrays is quite simple, you can get a lot of different information, the length of the array, a specific piece of information, you can add things and delete things and usually [ ] are used to manipulate arrays
    </p>
    <p>
      With objects, you access the properties by calling the property name ie morning.alarm();
    </p>
    <p>
      We then use things called functions, and functions basically are the equations that do things to the variables, arrays and objects and make them do things for us. They take the input that we have given them and give us output.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am still wrapping my head around JavaScript, so I am not sure if this will make sense to anyone but me. I will probably go through these courses again in a week or two and hope to understand it all a bit more.
