  <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>
  <p class="pullquote">It's like smashing your head into a brick wall</p>

    <h4>Tuesday the 21st of November</h4>
    <p>
      Oh man! so the past couple of days have been full on for me! learning Javascript has been a lot of problem solving! actually, all of this code stuff has been a lot of problem solving…
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure if I can remember all of the specific things that have happened but I do know what I get stuck on, and how I have figured it out..
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting off with CSS I knew the technical design terms for things and how stuff worked, and i had a design in mind but I had no idea what code would give me the results I wanted, so I went to google, and looked at CSS libraries, this was a massive help, and gave me all of the words and syntax rules, if something still didn’t work I looked at problems other people have had, and if I understood bits of the code I would try and decode them and even copied and pasted into my worksheet to see what the bits of code actually did.. I was super surprised at how effective google is with learning how to code!
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript has been a little more tricky, I can understand what people want me to do, but figuring out how it all works, its like I learn one thing and feel like I get a grasp of it, and then move on to the next thing and completely forget the rules I have just learnt, so when I am asked to do things I learnt 15-20 minutes ago I am stumped. but I overcame those issues by sitting down and looking at what I need to do, i.e I need something to use a ‘loop’ to get my desired result, I would just reference back to when I learnt about loops, read through it again and use that as a reference to write the bit of code I need.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find JavaScript harder to problem solve through google because I don’t understand enough of the language to really understand other peoples simple problems to see how they have been solved.. I think that will just take time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both of these examples I have begun with optimism, struggled, used trial and error and then felt really good when it was doing the thing I wanted it to. With the biggest issues I have had, where I have felt most blocked the best thing I have done actually is take a break, and then when I came back to it and worked on it again, I figured it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this process trial and error and finding other solutions has solidified knowledge and taught me the importance of using other people for help rather than pulling my hair out trying to figure it out all by myself..
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my journey thus far the problem solving skills I feel most comfortable with, and have worked the best have been googling, and trying something, and reading the error messages (when I understand them). I think through this journey other techniques that will become more valuable will be pseudocode, reading error messages, improving my processes through understanding syntax, reflection and repetition and getting help from other students and the coaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am terrible at explaining things most of the time so the rubber ducky method will probably not serve me too well, and I still don’t fully grasp debugging and console.logging, but I am sure though time it will become more obvious how beneficial they can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here are three functions I am yet to use and what they do. the thing that ties these three functions together is that they work on arrays (lists of information, think of a shopping list as an array “shopping list” is the name of the array and then you have everything on it being a part of the array such as [“eggs”, “bread”, “coffee”])
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>.map ( )</b> This allows you to do something to the objects in the array and then set it to a new array,
    <br>
      <b>.filter ( )</b> This allows you to filter through an array, just say you want everything that starts with the letter B, or all of the things on the list that are 6 letters long, this would be the function you would call.
      <br>
      <b>.reduce ( )</b> This function reduces the array to the single value, using a function with two parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has been a long blog post! I hope you have been able to follow my train of thought.
